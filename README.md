# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### please run `npm start` to install the needed dependencies

I used react-bootstrap and moment for the making of this project

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.


## Answer To Questions

### How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?

Since this project is a series of get functions, it doesn't really need a react-redux structure with the action folder and reducers folder
I just simply used a pages folder where I put all my screens and a component folder where I stored components and used called them in my screen 

### Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?

I can improve this project by working more on it's UI/UX. It can use more icons, pagination. I could also work more on the home page, 404 page and loading screen
where the design can be much more improved. I can also add a real backend to it using node.js and mongoDB (as in MERN fullstack) and even implement some other functionalities (cart, forms ...)

### What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
